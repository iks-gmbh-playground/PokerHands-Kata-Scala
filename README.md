##PokerHands-Kata 
###from The Coding Dojo Handbook by Emily Bache
In this Kata I wanted see how it feels to do TDD with Scala using the scalatest-framework.

scalatest offers various syntax flavours. Here I used flatspec. flatspec tests are very good readable.

One thing I miss is a smooth way to create test skeletons. In jUnit I am used to creating a test by selecting it from the context menu.
I don't have this feature in the IDE yet.
